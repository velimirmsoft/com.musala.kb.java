Task - OOP

Description 
Write a similar class hierarchy that contains at least one abstract class, at least three different interfaces, at least four classes derived from the abstract class. 
At least one final class derived from the subclasses of the abstract class. Put all of the classes and interfaces in separate packages depending on their purpose. Follow naming conventions. 
Add appropriate fields and methods (depending on your idea) in the abstract class and the derived classes.
Some of them should implement the interfaces and provide specific implementation of the methods in them. Please keep in mind the following things:
-Follow the OOP design principles writing your classes (SOLID) 
-Keep the Coupling loose and the Cohesion high.
Use one test class in order to test the custom classes and their objects for printing the information for every object. 
Use polymorphism by creating methods which accept type of your abstract class for printing the information for all of the objects. 
Create a logger class that can log the whole information for a specific object and saves it to a file (output.txt) on your system. Use polymorphism.
