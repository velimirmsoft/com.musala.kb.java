1. 
	Write a program that counts the number of unique words in a large text file (say, Moby Dick or the King James Bible).
	Store the words in a collection and report the # of unique words.
	
	Once you've created this collection, allow the user to search it to see whether various words appear in the text file.

2. 
	Modify the word count program to print every word that appeared in the book at least 1000 times, 
	in sorted order from least to most occurrences.

3. 
	Modify the program to eliminate any words that are all-uppercase from the collection.

4. 
	Write a program to count the occurrences of each word in a large text file (e.g. Moby Dick or the King James Bible).
	Allow the user to type a word and report how many times that word appeared in the book.
	Report all words that appeared in the book at least 500 times, in alphabetical order.
